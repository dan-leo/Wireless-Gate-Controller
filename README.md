# Wireless-Gate-Controller
This is a project for E-design 314. 

ADC current reading + display reading works.
<br>
Infrared tx (manchester encoding) works. (tx on G14 only for now -- just for debugging purposes).

TODO: 
add pinout here<br>
make this all more user friendly!! :)


Debugging: have a look at the debug.h folder and 
change variables to enable certain debugging outputs
